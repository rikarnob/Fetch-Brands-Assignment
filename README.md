## Note to hiring team

Please find my completed take-home assignment attached.

A quick note on my approach: My first goal was to deliver a preliminary answer quickly, like a minimum viable product. 
I chose Python with Pandas over SQL for this, as it allowed for much faster data exploration and initial insights with these JSON files. 
Python's flexibility made the JSON flattening and type conversions far more efficient, ultimately saving me time in getting to some quick answers.

I'm comfortable with SQL too, but for this initial phase, Python was the path to quickly demonstrate understanding and provide initial results.

I would also like to note that the `.ipynb` file contains my python codes and the email-to-stakeholders is my drafted email to the business and product teams.

Additionally, in the ERD, the link between receipts and brands is dotted since it doesn't actually exist today but that is one that logically makes sense. I've placed questions around that relationship in the email to stakeholders.

I've also updaloded the raw JSON files for reference.

I'm excited about this opportunity and look forward to discussing my submission with you.

Best regards,

Rik
